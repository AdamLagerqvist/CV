                <p>Adept at using all kinds of guns such as sniper rifles and assault rifles, but my personal preferences is the hand gun. I also know a lot of martial arts some examples are karate, Kungfu, taekwondo and breakdancing. Iâ€™m a creative and a very quick thinker, which is extremely important when you are up against a strong opponent.</p>
